1: Three ways to reduce gas in DNSClaimChecker.sol

-Avoid unnecessary storage operations: The Buffer library creates a new buffer for each call to getOwnerAddress. Since the Buffer is only used to construct the buf variable, which is a memory variable, we can replace the Buffer with a memory array.
-Optimize loop variables: The parseRR function contains a loop that increments the idx variable by 1 and then adds len to it. This can be optimized by incrementing idx by len + 1 in each iteration of the loop.
-Remove unnecessary variables: The found variable in the parseString function is unnecessary since the function always returns a boolean value. We can remove the found variable and return false directly when the string does not start with "a=0x".

2:Use a single substring function call to extract both the exponent and modulus values from the key input, rather than using separate calls.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-ens/blob/main/contracts/dnssec-oracle/algorithms/RSASHA1Algorithm.sol

The verify function in the RSASHA1Algorithm contract extracts the exponent and modulus values from the key input using two separate substring function calls:
if (exponentLen != 0) {
    exponent = key.substring(5, exponentLen);
    modulus = key.substring(
        exponentLen + 5,
        key.length - exponentLen - 5
    );
} else {
    exponentLen = key.readUint16(5);
    exponent = key.substring(7, exponentLen);
    modulus = key.substring(
        exponentLen + 7,
        key.length - exponentLen - 7
    );
}
This results in two separate byte array allocations, which can be expensive in terms of gas costs.

To optimize this code and reduce gas costs, you can use a single substring function call to extract both the exponent and modulus values from the key input. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve this:
uint16 offset = 5;
if (uint16(key.readUint8(offset)) == 0) {
    offset += 2;
}
uint16 exponentLen = uint16(key.readUint8(offset));
exponent = key.substring(offset + 1, exponentLen);
modulus = key.substring(offset + exponentLen + 1, key.length - offset - exponentLen - 1);

Here, we first initialize the offset variable to 5, which is the starting position of the exponent length field in the key input. We then check if the exponent length field is encoded as a single byte or a two-byte value, and adjust the offset accordingly.
Next, we extract the exponent value by calling substring with the starting position set to offset + 1 and the length set to exponentLen.
Finally, we extract the modulus value by calling substring with the starting position set to offset + exponentLen + 1 and the length set to key.length - offset - exponentLen - 1.
By using a single substring function call instead of two separate calls, we can reduce the number of byte array allocations and potentially save on gas costs.


2: Performing elliptic curve operations on the P-256 curve can be computationally expensive and it can be reduce

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-ens/blob/main/contracts/dnssec-oracle/algorithms/P256SHA256Algorithm.sol

Elliptic curve operations on the P-256 curve can be computationally expensive, which can lead to high gas costs for transactions that call the verify function in this code. This means that if an attacker were to repeatedly call the verify function with malicious inputs, they could potentially cause denial of service attacks by consuming a large amount of gas and preventing other transactions from being processed.
To mitigate this issue, it is important to carefully consider the gas costs of the operations used in the smart contract and take appropriate measures to reduce gas usage where possible. For example, the verify function could potentially be optimized by caching public keys to avoid recomputing the same elliptic curve operations multiple times. Additionally, it may be possible to batch multiple signature verification requests into a single transaction to reduce gas costs.
It is also important to consider the gas limits of the Ethereum network and ensure that the gas limits for transactions that call the verify function are set appropriately to avoid running out of gas and failing to execute the transaction.

3: Three ways in this contract to save some of gas:

One possible optimization could be to remove the "virtual" modifier from the "verifyRRSet" and "validateSignedSet" functions. This modifier is not necessary, as these functions are not intended to be overridden in derived contracts. Removing it could reduce the gas cost of function calls to these functions.
Another optimization could be to store the results of the "algorithms" and "digests" mappings in local variables, rather than accessing them directly in the loop. This could reduce the number of storage reads and gas cost of the loop.
Additionally, it may be possible to optimize the logic of the "validateSignedSet" function to reduce the number of loops and conditionals. For example, instead of iterating over all the RR records in the set twice (once to calculate the digest and again to verify the signature), it is possible to do both operations in a single loop.
