 High Gas Consumption in RRUtils Library

Overview:
The RRUtils library contains functions for parsing DNS resource records. However, it has been reported that some of the functions in this library consume more gas than necessary, potentially resulting in high gas fees for users. This report aims to identify and describe the issue, and provide recommendations for improvement.


Description:
 It appears that the nameLength and labelCount functions may be consuming more gas than necessary due to the use of the assert statement within the while loop. Specifically, the assert statement checks that the index is less than the length of the input byte array, which is a valid check to ensure the loop doesn't run infinitely. However, the assert statement also causes an out-of-gas error when the loop has iterated over the entire input byte array. This can happen when the input byte array is invalid or malformed, or when the loop has iterated over the entire name in the byte array.

In addition, the next function in the RRIterator struct also has a potential gas issue due to the use of the if statement to check if the offset is greater than or equal to the length of the input byte array. This check is valid to ensure that the iterator does not read past the end of the byte array, but it also adds additional gas consumption.

Impact:
The high gas consumption in the affected functions may cause an increase in gas fees for users who interact with contracts that use the RRUtils library. This could negatively impact user experience and adoption, as well as limit the usability of these contracts on low-cost networks.

Recommendation:
To address the issue, the assert statement in the nameLength and labelCount functions could be replaced with a require statement that returns an error message when the loop has iterated over the entire byte array. This would prevent the out-of-gas error and provide more informative feedback to users about the issue with the input data.

Similarly, the if statement in the next function could be replaced with a require statement that checks that the offset is less than the length of the input byte array. This would provide a more informative error message and prevent the function from unnecessarily consuming gas.

In addition, further optimization could be achieved by reducing the number of operations within the affected functions. For example, the nameLength and labelCount functions could be refactored to avoid the need for the while loop entirely by using recursion or other techniques to process the byte array more efficiently.

Conclusion:
The high gas consumption in the affected functions in the RRUtils library could be improved by replacing the assert and if statements with require statements that provide more informative feedback to users and prevent unnecessary gas consumption.
