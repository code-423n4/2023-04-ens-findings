## on parseRR() if the user enters very large data it might be DOS

each RR may have a different data length. but if the data provided by the user is very large. the parseRR() function will process all RRs in the data so that it can take a long time to process and convert data

``` solidity
ens\DNSClaimChecker.sol
57:             (addr, found) = parseString(rdata, idx, len);

ens\DNSClaimChecker.sol
46: function parseRR(
47:         bytes memory rdata,
48:         uint256 idx,
49:         uint256 endIdx
50:     ) internal pure returns (address, bool) {
51:         while (idx < endIdx) {
52:             uint256 len = rdata.readUint8(idx);
53:             idx += 1;
54: 
55:             bool found;
56:             address addr;
57:             (addr, found) = parseString(rdata, idx, len);
58: 
59:             if (found) return (addr, true);
60:             idx += len;
61:         }
62: 
63:         return (address(0x0), false);
64:     }
```
### Recommendations
validate the parseRR() function to check if the given data size exceeds the allowed limit

## consider on resolveCallback() and resolve() can call back
One reason why resolveCallback() and resolve() can call back is because OffchainDNSResolver relies on two functions to help build a query to retrieve data from the DNS server: the resolve() function to send the actual DNS request and the resolveCallback() function to take care of parsing the results returned from the DNS server. Since these two functions are an integral part of the main function of the contract, it is possible that the resolveCallback() and resolve() functions may require a callback to complete the execution of a DNS query which requires several stages of data processing.

``` solidity
ens\OffchainDNSResolver.sol
48: 
49:     function resolve(
50:         bytes calldata name,
51:         bytes calldata data
52:     ) external view returns (bytes memory) {
53:         string[] memory urls = new string[](1);
54:         urls[0] = gatewayURL;
55: 
56:         revert OffchainLookup(
57:             address(this),
58:             urls,
59:             abi.encodeCall(IDNSGateway.resolve, (name, TYPE_TXT)),
60:             OffchainDNSResolver.resolveCallback.selector,
61:             abi.encode(name, data)
62:         );
63:     }


ens\OffchainDNSResolver.sol
102:           if (dnsresolver != address(0)) {
103:                 if (
104:                     IERC165(dnsresolver).supportsInterface(
105:                         IExtendedDNSResolver.resolve.selector
106:                     )
107:                 ) {
108:                     return
109:                         IExtendedDNSResolver(dnsresolver).resolve(
110:                             name,
111:                             query,
112:                             context
113:                         );
114:                 } else if (
115:                     IERC165(dnsresolver).supportsInterface(
116:                         IExtendedResolver.resolve.selector
117:                     )
118:                 ) {
119:                     return IExtendedResolver(dnsresolver).resolve(name, query);
120:                 } else {
121:                     (bool ok, bytes memory ret) = address(dnsresolver)
122:                         .staticcall(query);
123:                     if (ok) {
124:                         return ret;
125:                     } else {
126:                         revert CouldNotResolve(name);
127:                     }
128:                 }
129:             }

```
### Recommendations
perform data validation and sanitization at any time to prevent attacks resulting in OffchainDNResolver contracts taking control by attackers.

## Confusing use of hexadecimal notation

confusing hexadecimal 0x6745230100EFCDAB890098BADCFE001032547600C3D2E1F0, which is hard to understand and makes code maintenance difficult.
``` solidity
ens\SHA1.sol
21: 
22:             let h := 0x6745230100EFCDAB890098BADCFE001032547600C3D2E1F0
```
### Recommendations
it's better to use Solidity's built-in hash function like keccak256 or a more secure hash like SHA-2 or SHA-3 to avoid security vulnerabilities like collision attacks and errors in hash algorithms
